# Algorithm Visualizer Project

Created by Jake Waclawski.
Inspired by Cl√©ment Mihailescu's [Pathfinding Visualizer Project](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Pathfinding-Visualizer).

The project can be accessed here: [jmw3638.github.io/Algorithm-Visualizer](https://jmw3638.github.io/Algorithm-Visualizer/)
Google Chrome is the recommended browser for this project,
it has not been tested on other web browsers.

## React
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
